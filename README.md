# nba_analyzer

Brief:
    When you are picking a fantasy basketball lineup, or any choice of chance for that matter, you have a plethora of tells and signs to aid you in making the right decision. Ultimately, we make our choices through a system of analyzation mixed with presumptions, hypothesis, and hunches. If you can manage these recipes in a way that success shines upon your lineup selections you may have a long fruitful career in a wide range of industries, whether it be stock picking, bond picking, maybe even a hedge fund, or good old fashioned fantasy basketball manager. 
    We are hoping to answer if there is any hope in our fantasy leagues by following what the experts do- that is selecting basketball players that are paid more than their peers, picking the players for our lineups that the General Managers pay to play for theres? 
    Maybe this will help us think about high expense funds, when there is often a low cost option readily available.. or maybe GM's in the NBA just need to have a look at our programming application.
